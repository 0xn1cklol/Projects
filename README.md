Sample.xlsx is the name of the excel file that sample.py is pulling from

sample.py will open the excel file and find the rows and transfer them to a new file called "file"

ExampleDOC Output is an example of how the script will transfer data if you could not run the script for some reason at a particular moment

sample.py also contains a verify feature to verify that the file contents were transferred correctly 

script usage is extremely simple. [python sample.py]

This was made quick as a request from my director.

Future Implementations would include:
  - Ask input for selecting which files
  - Ask input for naming file to output and location
  - Format data based on the users need
